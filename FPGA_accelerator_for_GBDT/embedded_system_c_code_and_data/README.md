# FILES DESCRIPTION

## main.c

This file contains the c code to copy into your SDK project.

## IP_data.h, KSC_data.h, PU_data.h, SV_data.h

These files contain:
  
  * *u32 class[NUM_CLASSES][MAX_NUM_NODES]*: A matrix "class" with the trees of
    the trained model. Each row contains the trees of one class. The format of
    each node corresponds with:
    
        Non-leaf node representation:
        |31     -     24|23    -     8|7      -      1|     0     |
        |- num_feature -|- cmp_value -|- right_child -|- is_leaf -|

        Leaf node representation:
        |31    -     16|15    -     2|        1       |     0     |
        |- pred_value -|- next_tree -|- is_last_tree -|- is_leaf -|
  
  * *u32 pixel[NUM_PIXELS][NUM_FEATURES]*: A matrix "pixel" with the entire test
    bench used, i.e. all the pixels of the image that have not been used during
    training. Each row contains one pixel.
  
  * *u32 label[NUM_PIXELS]*: A vector with the labels of each pixel in "pixel".
  
## platform.c, platform.h, platform_config.h

These files are generated by the SDK environment when you open a "helloword"
template, so you should probably use your own generated files according to your
own device.
